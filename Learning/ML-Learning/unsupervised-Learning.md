## 📌 Introduction

Unlike supervised learning, there are no predefined output labels in unsupervised learning. The algorithm analyzes the dataset and groups similar data points together.

---

## ⚙️ How Unsupervised Learning Works

1. 📂 Collect the dataset.
2. 📊 Provide unlabeled data to the algorithm.
3. 🔍 Analyze the data and identify patterns.
4. 🧩 Group similar data points.
5. 📈 Use the discovered patterns for analysis and decision-making.

## 📌 What is Hierarchical Clustering?

Hierarchical Clustering builds a tree-like structure called a **Dendrogram**, which shows how clusters are formed.

Unlike K-Means, you do not need to specify the number of clusters beforehand.

---

## 🛠️ Types of Hierarchical Clustering

### 🔹 Agglomerative Clustering (Bottom-Up)

* Initially, each data point is treated as a separate cluster.
* The closest clusters are merged step by step.
* The process continues until all points belong to a single cluster.

### 🔹 Divisive Clustering (Top-Down)

* Initially, all data points belong to one cluster.
* The cluster is repeatedly divided into smaller clusters.
* The process continues until every data point becomes its own cluster.

---

## ⚙️ Working of Hierarchical Clustering

1. Consider each data point as a separate cluster.
2. Calculate the distance between all clusters.
3. Merge the two closest clusters.
4. Update the distance matrix.
5. Repeat the process until only one cluster remains.
